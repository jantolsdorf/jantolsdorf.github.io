	abstract = {The European General Data Protection Regulation requires the implementation of Technical and Organizational Measures (TOMs) to reduce the risk of illegitimate processing of personal data. For these measures to be effective, they must be applied correctly by employees who process personal data under the authority of their organization. However, even data processing employees often have limited knowledge of data protection policies and regulations, which increases the likelihood of misconduct and privacy breaches. To lower the likelihood of unintentional privacy breaches, TOMs must be developed with employees’ needs, capabilities, and usability requirements in mind. To reduce implementation costs and help organizations and IT engineers with the implementation, privacy patterns have proven to be effective for this purpose. In this chapter, we introduce the privacy pattern Data Cart, which specifically helps to develop TOMs for data processing employees. Based on a user-centered design approach with employees from two public organizations in Germany, we present a concept that illustrates how Privacy by Design can be effectively implemented. Organizations, IT engineers, and researchers will gain insight on how to improve the usability of privacy-compliant tools for managing personal data.},

In this chapter, we propose three concrete practical methods that enable the reader to develop usable security and privacy (USP) solutions using the HCD process. This chapter equips the reader with the procedural knowledge and recommendations to: (1) derive mental models with regard to security and privacy, (2) analyze USP needs and privacy-related requirements, and (3) collect user characteristics on privacy and structure them by user group profiles and into privacy personas. Together, these approaches help to design measures for a user-friendly implementation of security and privacy measures based on a firm understanding of the key stakeholders.},

	abstract = {AbstractApplied privacy research has so far focused mainly on consumer relations in private life. Privacy in the context of employment relationships is less well studied, although it is subject to the same legal privacy framework in Europe. The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has strengthened employees’ right to privacy by obliging that employers provide transparency and intervention mechanisms. For such mechanisms to be effective, employees must have a sound understanding of their functions and value. We explored possible boundaries by conducting a semi-structured interview study with 27 office workers in Germany and elicited mental models of the right to informational self-determination, which is the European proxy for the right to privacy. We provide insights into (1) perceptions of different categories of data, (2) familiarity with the legal framework regarding expectations for privacy controls, and (3) awareness of data processing, data flow, safeguards, and threat models. We found that legal terms often used in privacy policies used to describe categories of data are misleading. We further identified three groups of mental models that differ in their privacy control requirements and willingness to accept restrictions on their privacy rights. We also found ignorance about actual data flow, processing, and safeguard implementation.},

Applications are decomposed into functional components of which most are provided by third parties usually deployed as software services scattered around the network. Available services can be discovered and orchestrated by service consumers in a flexible and on-the-fly manner. To do so, a standardized specification of the service’s functionalities is required. Apart from functional aspects, such an interface definition language needs to offer expressions for specifying important non-functional facets in addition, such as security. With WSDL and WS-Security such a standardized service description language and a mature security framework are available for the SOAP domain. For REST-based web services such standards are, however, missing. To overcome these shortcomings, many distinct sources propose service description languages and security schemes for REST-based web services. This paper provides a systematic analysis of these languages with a specific focus on their ability to express security policies. The obtained results reveal substantial limitations in all analyzed specification languages.},

Privacy dashboards have been discussed as possible tools for implementing this right, and are increasingly found in practice. However, investigations of real world implementations are sparse. We therefore qualitatively examined the extent to which privacy dashboards of ten online services complied with the essential requirements of Art. 15 GDPR. For this, we compared the information provided in dashboards with the information provided in privacy statements and data exports. We found that most privacy dashboards provided a decent initial overview, but lacked important information about purposes, recipients, sources, and categories of data that online users consider to be sensitive. In addition, both the privacy dashboards and the data exports lacked copies of personal data that were processed according to the online services’ own privacy statements. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of current implementations in terms of their ability to fulfill the objective of Art. 15 GDPR, namely to create awareness about data processing. We conclude by providing an outlook on what steps would be necessary for privacy dashboards to facilitate the exercise of the right of access and to provide real added value for online users.},

Based on the metaphor of a data cart, we developed a concept for a tool that supports employees in data management and data protection compliance. Qualitative usability testing revealed that participants expected the tool to raise their data protection awareness, reduce errors, and increase work efficiency. Our findings also suggest that if Privacy by Design becomes an integral part of digitalisation, employee perceptions of data protection may be positively altered.

The processing of employees' personal data is dramatically increasing, yet there is a lack of tools that allow employees to manage their privacy. In order to develop these tools, one needs to understand what sensitive personal data are and what factors influence employees’ willingness to disclose. Current privacy research, however, lacks such insights, as it has focused on other contexts in recent decades. To fill this research gap, we conducted a cross-sectional survey with 553 employees from Germany. Our survey provides multiple insights into the relationships between perceived data sensitivity and willingness to disclose in the employment context. Among other things, we show that the perceived sensitivity of certain types of data differs substantially from existing studies in other contexts. Moreover, currently used legal and contextual distinctions between different types of data do not accurately reflect the subtleties of employees’ perceptions. Instead, using 62 different data elements, we identified four groups of personal data that better reflect the multi-dimensionality of perceptions. However, previously found common disclosure antecedents in the context of online privacy do not seem to affect them. We further identified three groups of employees that differ in their perceived data sensitivity and willingness to disclose, but neither in},

Using thematic analysis, we find that human factors are seen as both a risk and an opportunity for information security. We identified various target groups, goals, and obstacles for the implementation of information security awareness programs. Existing structures and regulations promote the risk of a checklist mentality, potentially resulting in ineffective measures being implemented. One great opportunity for effective information security awareness programs lies in the exchange with staff units on safety and hygiene, who have decades of experience with awareness programs in medical facilities.
